# Open Source Auth API
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EmeraldSystemsLLC/auth-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EmeraldSystemsLLC/auth-api)

This is a open source auth API used by Acidity and many more services to login accounts and authorize using Discord and GitHub. I'm working on adding more features to this API.
